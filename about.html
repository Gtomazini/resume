	<h1 class="title__resume">My Bakumeko's trail</h1>
	<p class="about__content">Bakumenko’s trail is the path of achieving
	  something even if rough, Bakumenko was a soviet
	  draughts player erradicated in Brazil and his style game consists in winning with the
	  most complex and
	  sabotaged calculus,  and that’s is the human
	  life. I’m from Brazil and know better than anyone. A formed historian with focus on Micro
	  Economics but the pandemic slow down my plans and started my path in 2021 on the Computer
	  Engineer course of UNIVESP where I see a oportunity of achieving something important as
	  person and professional. In 2022 I’ve join the Industrial Electronic Tecnichian Course from
	  the Centro Paula Souza ETEC Jose Martimiano da Silva where I find my self as one of the best
	  students of Embebbed Systems and Internet of Things.</p>
	<p class="about__content">2023 i get my first job as Electronic Tecnichian and
	  Software Developer in
	  Bonther Labs (Ribeirao Preto - SP) where i made severous bug fix in desktop software writed
	  in Delphi (pascal’s son lol) and started a new one in modern C++ with boost and wxwidgets.
	  Was a great experience where a I’ve developed a rat hat in 3D print to use in anestesics
	  devices also a computer vision project called “Arena Tracking” using OpenCV helping
	  researchers in their Morri’s experiment and Maze timelapse. In this same year I
	  joined Grupo CRIAR (Ribeirao Preto - SP) where was more focused in Hardware Assembly with
	  QA using script shell in LTE devices, Raspberrys and GNSS. Then 2024 was the year where I’ve
	  realized that i need to develop more my software engineering skills so I applied for
	  Trends It a bootcamps that trains students in Fullstack and Mobile (I’ve choosen mobile) in
	  the end I get a internship in a brazilian startup called dbsnOOp (Sao Jose dos Campos - SP)
	  that sells products specialized in observability and monitoring as SAAS. This was my last
	  experience where I’ve learned a roadmap of a real SAAS product in QA and
	  Software Engineering.</p>
